Despite the tile, the focus of this project are not CP Decompositions. Rather,
their active use in searching for fast matrix multiplication algorithms. There
was a glimpse of these types of algorithms in \Cref{sec:Matrix-Matrix Products},
but the rabbit hole goes deeper than that. Therefore, the use of CP
Decompositons of a special tensor to discover new fast matrix multiplication
algorithms is left for \Cref{sec:The Matrix Multiplication Tensor}, and
\Cref{sec:Matrix Multiplication Algorithms} starts this chapter with some
much-needed background about Matrix Multiplication Algorithms.

% The goal for the first project is difficult to describe. Preliminary work on
% attempting to search for fast matrix multiplication algorithm shows that it is a
% daunting task. Even though exhaustive search is not enough to prove that an
% algorithm doesn't exist for certain ranks, it is clear that there are many more
% places where an algorithm fails to exist than the ones where it actually exists.
% But have implemented a new way of searching these algorithms much more
% efficiently than what was done in the past, and it could prove itself worthy of
% future use. We have more recently turned to a more mathematical approach to the
% project with the aid of Dr. Frank Moore and Dr. Pratyush Mishra. But where we
% are heading is still unknown. We wish to share some both the new method of
% searching for algorithm and some of the interesting solutions we found.

% The work done in the first project is more extensive. Recall that we can
% actively search for fast matrix multiplication algorithms by
% optimization as in \Cref{Opt}. We can do so by performing an CP
% Decomposition on the matrix multiplication tensor by specifying the size
% of the matrix $n$ and the number of multiplications in the algorithm
% $R$. This is described in algorithm \ref{alg:CP-DGN} where the details
% of how to compute the Function value, the gradient and the Jacobian are
% left as an exercise to the reader. But now, how do we modify it so that
% we can decrease the number of possibilities from $3^{84}$ to $3^{28}$ by
% relying on the cyclic invariance structure described earlier? The
% details of so can be seen in Algorithm \ref{alg:Mod-CP-DGN}. I once
% again leave the now much, much more complicated details of how to
% compute the function value, the gradient and the Jacobian as another
% exercise to the reader.

\JP{This is ongoing work. Essentially, we are searching for additional
structure in the solutions we have found. I will try to summarize the main ideas
in the talk as well as in this section before I graduate, but realistic the
precise writing of this section won't be in its full version before I graduate}
